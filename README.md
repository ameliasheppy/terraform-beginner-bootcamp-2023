## Semantic Versioning

More info available at:
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)


Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. eg `1.0.01`
- we do not need to do v1.0.01, even though many prefer to

We can also commit things to an issue, which is super cool!

## Linux info commands
To determine info on our system, run 
uname -srm <-tells you in you are using Linux
cat /etc/os-release <-gives more info on the Linux system
This is important bc the Linux version can affect different things that we do

## gitpod.yml file info
Has tasks in it that will help launch our terminals
