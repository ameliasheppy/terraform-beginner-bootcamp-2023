## Semantic Versioning

More info available at:
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)


Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. eg `1.0.01`
- we do not need to do v1.0.01, even though many prefer to

We can also commit things to an issue, which is super cool!
